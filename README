Good day. Let us introduce ourselves: we are researchers at Technische
Universit채t M체nchen, Germany.

This is Crossbear, a tool for tracing Men-in-the-middle trying to eavesdrop
and interfere with an HTTPs connection. Crossbear's purpose is to collect
data to a) find out whether such Men-in-the-middle exist and b) where in the
network they are located. It uses two methods. The first is a comparison of 
certificate chains from several points in the network, including a warning 
to the user when a different certificate chain is seen. In this respect, it
is very similar to Perspectives or Convergence. The second method, however,
is more important. It consists of creating Hunting Tasks which are then sent
out to Crossbear clients around the world. Each Hunting Task is a request to
traceroute to the indicated SSL server. The idea is that by correlating 
results from different vantage points it may be possible to derive where in
the network the attacker is located.

If you have further questions, have a look at our talks (slides) and a brief
introductory video from 28C3.

Crossbear comes as a Firefox plugin.

PRIVACY STATEMENT - YOU WANT TO READ THIS
=========================================

Your data is sent encrypted to our servers at Technische Universit채t M체nchen,
Germany. WE DO NOT SHARE IT WITH ANYONE ELSE AND USE IT ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE
OF CLASSIFYING MEN-IN-THE-MIDDLE. WE DO OUR BEST TO KEEP THE SERVERS SECURE
AND PREVENT DATA LEAKAGE TO ATTACKERS.

We store the following data:

- Source: IP address of requesting client and AS, because we need it to trace
the man-in-the-middle. We resolve to an AS in order to find other clients in
the same AS which might work as hunters.
- Certificate chains: as seen by clients and hunters.
- Traceroutes: from requesting client and from hunting tasks.
- Timestamps: when a request was made and a certain certificate chain seen

We do not store any other information. Not your name, nothing about your 
browser.

During the test period of Crossbear, your data will be stored on the servers
IN PLAIN. We will change when this Crossbear goes live. Bear in mind, however, 
that in order to be useful, the Crossbear server will always need to be able
to access recent data like certificate chains. It is part of its functionality.

Yes, that does mean we know which sites *some* client (with a certain IP) 
has accessed. If you don't want us to know about which sites you are visiting, 
deactivate Crossbear (and surf privately for that time).

*In fact, we encourage you to use Crossbear only when you suspect your current
connection to the Internet might be eavesdropped on and you want the assurance
that Crossbear can provide.* At any other time, it is wise (and will hurt our 
work only very little), if you deactivate Crossbear.

Let us repeat this: our goal is to trace men-in-the-middle, not users. We want
to gather hard data. If you want to help us with this, you are very welcome. 
We want to publish attacks that we learn about, and we can only do this with 
your help. However, if you feel you don't want to participate in the hunting,
but still want some reassurance, we can recommend Convergence (convergence.io).
In fact, Crossbear makes use of Convergence itself (as a kind of back-end to
have more vantage points).

If you have any questions, please do contact us. Our e-mail address is indicates
