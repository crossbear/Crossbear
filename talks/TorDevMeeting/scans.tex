\frametitle{Our position}
  \begin{block}{A first step towards gathering better data}
    \begin{itemize}
       \item We \textit{do not} advertise Crossbear as a silver bullet
       \item Best results can be expected against the non-selective attacker
       \item These are also the attackers we are most interested in
     \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Crossbear is deployed and ready}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item 150 hunters on PlanetLab
      \item 4,000 certificate reports -- no MitM
    \end{itemize}  
  \end{block}
