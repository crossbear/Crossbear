Preparations
============

You will need JDK 7.

Your JVM must be adjusted to run the Java Hunters properly: 
UnlimitedJCEPolicy has to be installed - unzip the files contained therein
and place in the correct locations for your OS (a quick Google check
will give you those). E.g., on a Linux it might be

/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_07/jre/lib/security/

Finally, "jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms" in java.security has to be 
set to "BLABLABLA" (same location).


Compiling
=========
The key to compiling everything is to compile step by step:
first server/fourhundredfortythree (including the code in com.google),
server/eighty, finally CBJavaHunter.

You will need to set up your CLASSPATH to include, assuming $BASE as 
the directory where you store Crossbear:

$BASE/server/fourhundredfourtythree/src/crossbear
$BASE/server/fourhundredfourtythree/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/bcprov-jdk16-146.jar
$BASE/server/fourhundredfourtythree/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/json_simple-1.1.jar
$BASE/server/eighty/src


Running
=======

Simply do "java JavaHunter".
