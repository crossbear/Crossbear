Preparations
============

You will need JDK 7.

If you do not run OpenJDK, but an export-limited JDK (like the Oracle
JDK), then your JVM must be adjusted to run the Java Hunters properly.
For Oracle JDK, UnlimitedJCEPolicy has to be installed - unzip the
files contained therein and place in the correct locations for your OS
(a quick Google check will give you those). E.g., on a Linux it might
be /usr/java/jdk1.7.0_07/jre/lib/security/. Finally,
"jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms" in java.security has to be set to
"BLABLABLA" (same location).

If you have OpenJDK, you should be OK from the start.

Compiling
=========
The key to compiling everything is to compile step by step:
first server/fourhundredfortythree (including the code in com.google),
server/eighty, finally CBJavaHunter.

You will need to set up your CLASSPATH to include, assuming $CBHOME as 
the directory where you store Crossbear:

$CBHOME/server/fourhundredfourtythree/src/
$CBHOME/server/fourhundredfourtythree/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/bcprov-jdk16-146.jar
$CBHOME/server/fourhundredfourtythree/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/json_simple-1.1.jar
$CBHOME/server/eighty/src

I.e. for bash/zsh:
export CLASSPATH=$CBHOME/server/fourhundredfourtythree/src/:$CBHOME/server/fourhundredfourtythree/src/crossbear/messaging/:$CBHOME/server/fourhundredfourtythree/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/bcprov-jdk16-146.jar:$CBHOME/server/fourhundredfourtythree/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/json_simple-1.1.jar:$CBHOME/server/eighty/src/

Then:
In server/fourhundredfourtythree/src/crossbear/: javac *java
In server/eighty/src/crossbear: javac *.java
In CBJavaHunter/src/crossbear: javac *.java

Running
=======

Simply do "java JavaHunter".
