This tarball contains the files and instructions to set up two 
scenarios to test Crossbear's functionality. The second one
is actually the easier one, but the first one is the more
"interesting" one.

Before you start: install the Crossbear XPI on all hosts that 
you intend to use. We recommend taking the version 
from https://github.com/crossbear/Crossbear.

1) poisoned_access_point:
Idea: Forging a rogue wireless access point.
Goal: detect rogue certificate, get warning, create hunting task.
section_6.1.pdf explains the idea of the setup. sslsniff is provided
together with instructions (commands...) to set it up. You really
need the following hosts:
- victim server
- victim client, attached to router via attacker
- hunter, attached to router
- router
- attacker between victim client and router.

On your attacker:
Create a directory of your liking, put the my.hypovereinsbank.de.crt 
there and replace the path /home/YOURUSER/certs with the directory's 
name.
On the attacker: Execute the commands in commands_to_execute to stage
the attack. 

On the client: In your /etc/hosts, put an entry for my.hypovereinsbank.de.

Use Wireshark to watch network traffic.
Access my.hypovereinsbank.de. with the client.




2) squid_mitm:
Idea: Using a Squid proxy that does a MitM against the Crossbear server.
Goal: Let client detect MitMed connection to Crossbear server

section_6.2.pdf explains the idea of the setup. You need:
- victim
- attacker
- server

On the attacker: install Squid and edit the squid.conf. You find what you
need in squid_add2conf.txt Again, create a directory of your liking and 
give it the path (YOURUSER/...). Put the trusted.pem there. You're good
to go.





PS:
The folder ca contains more certificates that you may find helpful in 
your testing.
