Installing OONIBear:

Instructions are for Debian and derived distributions. We will
install OONIBear as symlinks into the ooni-probe directory.
The Crossbear/OONIBear repo can reside anywhere on your drive.

1) Installing OONI (www.ooni.nu)

Clone the OONI repository.

Mostly, we can follow the instructions given in OONI. In particular,
we also recommend using a virtualenv. However, OONI's instructions
here are not up to date - we recommend having a look at
           http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/
for the correct installation instructions.

Once you got your virtualenv set up (we do it with system-site 
packages enabled), we also recommend you install libdnet from the
tar ball (see OONI readme), but pypcap from the distro repositories.
The work-flow as given in the OONI readme will not work.

Then, do the pip -r requirements.txt as given in the OONI install
instructions.


2) Installing OONIBear.

Switch to the OONIBear branch to get the latest development version
of OONIBear.

Create symlinks in path/to/ooni-probe:

ln -s /path/to/OONIBear.py
ln -s /path/to/cb.conf
ln -s /path/to/cbserver.crt

In /path/to/ooni-probe/ooni:
ln -s /path/to/PyHunter

Switch to the new PyHunter dir. Kill any symlinks you find in there
(if there are any). Now, in this dir:

ln -s /path/to/cbutils
ln -s /path/to/cbmessaging

That's it. OONIBear will now be accessible to OONI.


3) Calling OONIBear from OONI
Once you've done that, change to root (sudo -s) and then activate
the virtualenv. That's important as otherwise OONI/OONIBear won't
find the necessary python libs (calling ooni-probe with sudo from
within a virtualenv will kick you out of the virtualenv).

In practice, we have not found it necessary to start Tor for running
OONIBear, but it will work, too.
