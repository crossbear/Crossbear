Problems with yawhois:
	Raise errors instead of handeling them properly
	Lack multiple tlds
	No proper connection to whois server in case of com.br
	! It was not possible to rely on the probaly faster implementation with sockets. for some reason, german hosts, did not reply with a full msg.
	! Another problem ist the Timezone Abbr. which is from time to time included. I try a workaround with regex.

	Domains like *.es are kinda difficult to query. They are neither supportet by unix's own whois nor by telneting DNS servers
		Also *.ar, 
	Domains like torrentz.eu do not show date infromations
	Popular domains like google.{es, ar, ...} show up a lot. The question is how interesting is google all the time.

Whois problems:
		--> someGuy.blogspot.com
		just second-level domains
		
	
Domain specific requests:
	WHOIS LIMIT EXCEEDED - SEE WWW.PIR.ORG/WHOIS FOR DETAILS
	fgets: Connection reset by peer
